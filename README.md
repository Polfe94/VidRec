Software for customized video / image recording with FLIR cameras. 


## How to
First of all, the Spinnaker API needs to be downloaded (https://flir.app.boxcn.net/v/SpinnakerSDK/folder/68522911814) and installed. After this, we can create a Python environment (versions 3.6 to 3.8, newer versions seem not to be supported), and download the proper wheel file (i.e. https://flir.app.boxcn.net/v/SpinnakerSDK/folder/74728365231 for Ubuntu 18.04). Then, from pip we can install this ".whl" file as usual (pip install /path/to/wheel.whl). Ready to go!
